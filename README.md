# soldato-api

This is a simple Springboot project for a REST API

In this application you can find examples of:
1. A simple CRUD Rest Spring Controller
2. Incapsulated business logic (a little anemic in this case) in service classes, decoupled from controllers using Inversion Of Control
3. JPA Entities
4. Springdata JPA Repositories
5. Validation of request bodies using Hibernate Validator
6. H2 on memory/file database for fast develop!
7. A simple markdown file!

## Controllers

A controller is implemented (here, in this project) in 2 Java files:
* The interface
* The concrete class


## Services

## Entities

## Repositories

## Validations
